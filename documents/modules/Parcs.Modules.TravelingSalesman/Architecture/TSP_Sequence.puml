actor User
participant "PARCS Controller" as Controller
participant "Main Module" as Main
participant "Worker 1" as W1
participant "Worker 2" as W2
participant "Worker N" as WN

User -> Controller: Deploy TSP Module
Controller -> Main: Initialize with options
Main -> Main: Generate cities
Main -> Main: Create worker points

note over Main: Distribute data to workers

Main -> W1: Send cities + parameters
Main -> W2: Send cities + parameters
Main -> WN: Send cities + parameters

note over W1, WN: Workers run local GA in parallel

W1 -> W1: Initialize population
W1 -> W1: Run generations
W1 -> W1: Find best route

W2 -> W2: Initialize population
W2 -> W2: Run generations
W2 -> W2: Find best route

WN -> WN: Initialize population
WN -> WN: Run generations
WN -> WN: Find best route

note over W1, WN: Send results back to main

W1 -> Main: Best route + distance
W2 -> Main: Best route + distance
WN -> Main: Best route + distance

note over Main: Combine results and find global best

Main -> Main: Compare all worker results
Main -> Main: Select global best route
Main -> Main: Calculate performance metrics

Main -> Controller: Return final results
Controller -> User: Display results

note over Main: Performance comparison
Main -> Main: Run sequential version
Main -> Main: Calculate speedup
Main -> Main: Generate convergence plots
